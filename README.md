# Mini Reconciliation Tool

## üìä Overview

The **Mini Reconciliation Tool** is a web application designed to help financial teams efficiently compare transaction data from their internal systems against statements from payment processors. This tool automates the process of identifying discrepancies, providing a clear summary and detailed categorization of transactions to streamline reconciliation efforts.

It's built with a focus on a clean, intuitive user interface and robust client-side data processing.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dual File Upload:** Easily upload two CSV files:
    * `Internal System Export`: Your platform's transaction records.
    * `Provider Statement`: The payment processor's reported transactions.
* **Intelligent Comparison:** Compares transactions primarily using a unique `transaction_reference`.
* **Categorized Discrepancies:** Presents reconciliation results in three distinct categories for immediate insight:
    * ‚úÖ **Matched Transactions:** Perfect matches found in both files.
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Present only in Internal File:** Transactions recorded by your system but missing from the provider's statement.
    * ‚ùå **Present only in Provider File:** Transactions reported by the provider but missing from your internal system.
* **Highlighted Mismatches (Bonus):** Automatically highlights specific discrepancies within matched transactions, such as `amount` or `status` differences.
* **Export Capabilities (Bonus):** Provides an "Export as CSV" button for each category, allowing users to download detailed reports for further analysis or action.
